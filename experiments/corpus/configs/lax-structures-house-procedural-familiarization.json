        "<p>Imagine you are an architect. Your boss has created some models for a new series of structures! They won't allow the models to leave the boardroom, but have asked you to write instructions describing each model so that anyone could recreate them from scratch. Your goal is to <strong>describe exactly what needs to be placed where, step by step, to accurately recreate each model.</strong></p></br><p>Before you begin, we'll give you a chance to practice writing clear instructions using our special interface. You can add instructions steps by clicking the <strong>add instruction steps</strong> button or by hitting the <strong>return key</strong>, as well as remove instruction steps if you accidentally add too many.</p></br><p>When you are done with your instructions, click <strong>SUBMIT INSTRUCTIONS</strong> to move onto the next structure. Your instructions do not need to be perfect, but please try your best! Press NEXT to see what the interface will look like.</p>"
