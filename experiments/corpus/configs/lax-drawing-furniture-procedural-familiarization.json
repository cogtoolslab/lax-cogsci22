They won't allow the drawings to leave the boardroom, but have asked you to write instructions describing each drawing so that anyone could recreate them from scratch. Your goal is to <strong>describe exactly what needs to be drawn where, step by step, to accurately recreate each drawing.</strong></p></br><p>Before you begin, we'll give you a chance to practice writing clear instructions using our special interface. You can add instructions steps by clicking the <strong>add instruction steps</strong> button or by hitting the <strong>return key</strong>, as well as remove instruction steps if you accidentally add too many.</p></br><p>When you are done with your instructions, click <strong>SUBMIT INSTRUCTIONS</strong> to move onto the next drawing. Your instructions do not need to be perfect, but please try your best!</p>"
